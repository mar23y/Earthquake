# Earthquake_Data
Hello everyone, I will share with you my project as a smart contract developer in blockchain.
This project is a smart contract or a backend of decentralized application that done information to the users for the last earthquake in morocco at (08/09/2023).
This smart contract include the data of all big and medium earthquake which morocco effected between the 8 and 14 September.
The user enters the number of any specified earthquake that is needed to know information about it and the information will appear.
5 earthkuake have a numbers from 1 to 5.
The data that will appear is [ Time ; Depth ; City ; magnitude ].
Finally, when this smart contract deployed in binance smart chain or polygon blockchain the fees of the transaction are a very low, 
When any user wants to get this information, they will pay a very small amount like between 0.001$ and 0.01$ (it's the fees of every transaction)
I hope that I explain is sufficient.
Thank you for your attentions.
